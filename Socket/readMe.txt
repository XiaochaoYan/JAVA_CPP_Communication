Compile and run the C++ server program using a suitable compiler (e.g., MinGW):

Copy code
g++ server.cpp -o server -lws2_32
./server.exe
Compile and run the Java client program:

Copy code
javac JavaClient.java
java JavaClient
You should see the C++ server program display the message "Received data: Hello from Java!" indicating the successful IPC between the Java client and C++ server on Windows.

Please note that you'll need to link against the ws2_32 library when compiling the C++ program on Windows.

Once again, I apologize for the confusion, and I hope this updated example works correctly for you.
