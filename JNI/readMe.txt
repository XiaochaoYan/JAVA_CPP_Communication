Compile the C++ JNI code into a shared library:

css
Copy code
g++ -shared -o nativeLibrary.dll -I"<path-to-jdk-include>" -I"<path-to-jdk-include>/win32" JNIImplementation.cpp
Copy the generated nativeLibrary.dll to the same directory as the Java program.

Compile and run the Java program:

Copy code
javac JavaBuffer.java
java JavaBuffer
The Java program creates a direct byte buffer, populates it with some data, and passes it to the native JNI method processBuffer(). The C++ code increments each byte in the buffer. Finally, the Java program retrieves the updated data from the buffer and prints it.

Note: The compilation command may vary depending on your operating system and JDK installation. Adjust the command and include paths accordingly.

Using buffer-like mechanisms through JNI allows you to exchange data efficiently between Java and C++ programs. You can manipulate the data in the buffer using native code and retrieve the updated data back in Java.
